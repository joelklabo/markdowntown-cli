# Claude Code Instructions (CLI)

- Follow `cli/AGENTS.md` for CLI-specific workflow and specs.
- Prefer `rg` for search and keep changes small and deterministic.
- Run `make lint` and `make test` from `cli/` before finishing work.
- Keep CLI outputs aligned with `cli/docs/scan-spec-v1.md` and `cli/docs/audit-spec-v1.md`.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly asked.
