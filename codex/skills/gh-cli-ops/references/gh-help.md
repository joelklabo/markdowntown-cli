## gh api
Makes an authenticated HTTP request to the GitHub API and prints the response.

The endpoint argument should either be a path of a GitHub API v3 endpoint, or
`graphql` to access the GitHub API v4.

Placeholder values `{owner}`, `{repo}`, and `{branch}` in the endpoint
argument will get replaced with values from the repository of the current
directory or the repository specified in the `GH_REPO` environment variable.
Note that in some shells, for example PowerShell, you may need to enclose
any value that contains `{...}` in quotes to prevent the shell from
applying special meaning to curly braces.

The default HTTP request method is `GET` normally and `POST` if any parameters
were added. Override the method with `--method`.

Pass one or more `-f/--raw-field` values in `key=value` format to add static string
parameters to the request payload. To add non-string or placeholder-determined values, see
`-F/--field` below. Note that adding request parameters will automatically switch the
request method to `POST`. To send the parameters as a `GET` query string instead, use
`--method GET`.

The `-F/--field` flag has magic type conversion based on the format of the value:

- literal values `true`, `false`, `null`, and integer numbers get converted to
  appropriate JSON types;
- placeholder values `{owner}`, `{repo}`, and `{branch}` get populated with values
  from the repository of the current directory;
- if the value starts with `@`, the rest of the value is interpreted as a
  filename to read the value from. Pass `-` to read from standard input.

For GraphQL requests, all fields other than `query` and `operationName` are
interpreted as GraphQL variables.

To pass nested parameters in the request payload, use `key[subkey]=value` syntax when
declaring fields. To pass nested values as arrays, declare multiple fields with the
syntax `key[]=value1`, `key[]=value2`. To pass an empty array, use `key[]` without a
value.

To pass pre-constructed JSON or payloads in other formats, a request body may be read
from file specified by `--input`. Use `-` to read from standard input. When passing the
request body this way, any parameters specified via field flags are added to the query
string of the endpoint URL.

In `--paginate` mode, all pages of results will sequentially be requested until
there are no more pages of results. For GraphQL requests, this requires that the
original query accepts an `$endCursor: String` variable and that it fetches the
`pageInfo{ hasNextPage, endCursor }` set of fields from a collection. Each page is a separate
JSON array or object. Pass `--slurp` to wrap all pages of JSON arrays or objects
into an outer JSON array.

For more information about output formatting flags, see `gh help formatting`.

USAGE
  gh api <endpoint> [flags]

FLAGS
      --cache duration        Cache the response, e.g. "3600s", "60m", "1h"
  -F, --field key=value       Add a typed parameter in key=value format
  -H, --header key:value      Add a HTTP request header in key:value format
      --hostname string       The GitHub hostname for the request (default "github.com")
  -i, --include               Include HTTP response status line and headers in the output
      --input file            The file to use as body for the HTTP request (use "-" to read from standard input)
  -q, --jq string             Query to select values from the response using jq syntax
  -X, --method string         The HTTP method for the request (default "GET")
      --paginate              Make additional HTTP requests to fetch all pages of results
  -p, --preview names         GitHub API preview names to request (without the "-preview" suffix)
  -f, --raw-field key=value   Add a string parameter in key=value format
      --silent                Do not print the response body
      --slurp                 Use with "--paginate" to return an array of all pages of either JSON arrays or objects
  -t, --template string       Format JSON output using a Go template; see "gh help formatting"
      --verbose               Include full HTTP request and response in the output
