# Prompt Recipes (Sketch Magic)

Use these as starting points. Keep the “friendly/safe/no weapons” language unless there’s a strong reason to change it.

## 1) Monster Friend
**Label:** Monster Friend
**Prompt:**
“Use the sketch as inspiration and create a friendly, realistic monster. Keep big kind eyes, a gentle smile, and soft textures. Add warm, cheerful colors and a simple background. Avoid anything scary or sharp.”

## 2) Zoomy Ride
**Label:** Zoomy Ride
**Prompt:**
“Turn the sketch into a friendly, realistic vehicle. Keep rounded shapes, bright cheerful colors, and playful details like stickers or smiling headlights. Add a clean, simple background and no weapons.”

## 3) Magic Pet
**Label:** Magic Pet
**Prompt:**
“Make the character a cute, realistic animal friend with soft fur and a gentle magical glow. Keep it playful, safe, and warm, with a cozy background.”

## 4) Brave Buddy
**Label:** Brave Buddy
**Prompt:**
“Turn the sketch into a brave, kind hero. Use bright, cheerful colors, soft costume textures, and a warm, storybook-realistic style. Keep everything friendly and safe.”

## Iteration Tips
- Change **one** variable per run (color, realism, background, texture).
- If output is too close to the sketch, add: “Create a polished, finished illustration.”
- If output is too stylized, add: “More realistic textures and lighting.”
- Avoid complex multi-sentence instructions that exceed prompt length limits.
