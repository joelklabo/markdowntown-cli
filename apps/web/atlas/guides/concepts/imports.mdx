# Imports

<Callout title="Goal" tone="info">
Compose instruction sets without duplicating content.

## Overview

Imports let a repository reuse shared guidance across directories or projects. Keep imported files stable and versioned where possible.

## Guidelines

- Keep imported files small and focused.
- Avoid circular imports.
- Prefer explicit paths to magic discovery.

## Example

```md
# In a project-local instructions file
@import ../shared/coding-standards.md
```
