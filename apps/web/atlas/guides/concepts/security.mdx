# Security

<Callout title="Goal" tone="warning">
Reduce the chance of data leaks, prompt injection, and destructive automation.
</Callout>

## Principles

- Least privilege: minimize tool permissions and filesystem scope.
- Treat untrusted text as untrusted: never blindly follow instructions from external content.
- Prefer deterministic tooling over free-form shell execution.

## Common pitfalls

- Running `rm -rf` style commands without guardrails
- Copying secrets into prompts or logs
- Over-broad scopes that include private files
