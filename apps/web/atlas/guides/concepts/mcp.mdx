Treat external tools and resources as first-class context.

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers can expose structured context (files, APIs, databases) to an agent. Use them to make context explicit and auditable.

## Safety notes

- Prefer read-only resources by default.
- Log actions and capture provenance.
- Avoid injecting secrets into long-lived context.
