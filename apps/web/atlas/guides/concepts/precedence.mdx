# Precedence

<Callout title="Goal" tone="info">
Define a predictable order for multiple instruction sources.
</Callout>

## Overview

When multiple files contribute instructions, you need a clear rule for which ones win when they conflict and how they compose.

## Practical defaults

- Prefer the most specific scope over broader scope.
- Prefer nearer files (closer to the working directory) over distant ones when specificity is equal.
- Prefer explicit tool configuration over inferred behavior.

## Example

```md
# Global instructions
Always format code.

# More specific instructions
In src/**, use 2-space indentation.
```
