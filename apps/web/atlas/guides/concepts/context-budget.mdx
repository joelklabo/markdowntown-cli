<Callout title="Goal" tone="info">
Keep prompts small enough to stay relevant and accurate.

## Overview

Large contexts can dilute important instructions. Curate context intentionally: include only what’s needed for the current task.

## Checklist

- Include the minimal file set that reproduces the behavior.
- Prefer summaries over full logs.
- Drop generated files and lockfiles unless needed.
