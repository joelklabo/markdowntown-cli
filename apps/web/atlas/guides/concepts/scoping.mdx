# Scoping

<Callout title="Goal" tone="info">
Limit instructions to the files and contexts where they apply.
</Callout>

## Overview

Scoping prevents unrelated instructions from leaking into prompts. Good scopes are narrow, stable, and easy to reason about.

## Patterns

- **Path globs**: apply to file paths (e.g. `src/**/*.ts`).
- **Language scopes**: apply by extension or language group.
- **Task scopes**: apply by command/intent (compile, test, review).

## Example

```md
# Scope: src/**/*.ts
Use explicit return types for exported functions.
```
