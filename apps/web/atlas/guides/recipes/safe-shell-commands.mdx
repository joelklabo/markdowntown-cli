# Safe shell commands

<Callout title="Outcome" tone="success">
Agents run commands safely with clear guardrails.
</Callout>

## Steps

1. Prefer read-only commands first (`rg`, `ls`, `cat`).
2. Require explicit approval for destructive actions (`rm`, `git reset`, migrations).
3. Use timeouts for long-running processes.

## Example

```sh
rg \"TODO\" src
```
