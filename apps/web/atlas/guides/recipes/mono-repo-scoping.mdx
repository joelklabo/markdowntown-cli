# Mono-repo scoping

<Callout title="Outcome" tone="success">
Agents follow the right standards per package without leaking rules across the repo.
</Callout>

## Steps

1. Create a top-level baseline file for repo-wide rules.
2. Add package-local instruction files for language/tooling differences.
3. Use narrow path globs to target each package.

## Example

```md
# packages/web/**
Use React server components where applicable.
```
