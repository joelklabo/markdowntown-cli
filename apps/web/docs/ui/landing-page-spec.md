# Landing page content spec (core flows)

Last updated: Dec 28, 2025

## Objective
Explain the 3 core flows and get users to value quickly with a clear CTA hierarchy.

## CTA hierarchy rules
- **Primary CTA:** Scan a folder.
- **Secondary CTA:** Open Workbench.
- **Tertiary link:** Library (optional, once).
- **One primary CTA per section.**

## Section map
1) **Hero (scan-first promise)**
   - Message: scan locally, see what loads, export agents.md fast.
   - Primary CTA: Scan a folder.
   - Secondary CTA: Open Workbench.
   - Trust line: Local-only scans; nothing uploaded.

2) **3-step path (scan → review → export)**
   - Steps:
     1. Scan a folder
     2. Review what loads
     3. Build + export agents.md
   - Supporting copy: one sentence on how fast the path is.
   - CTA: Open Workbench (secondary).

3) **Proof / output preview**
   - Message: what the user gets after scanning.
   - Visual: small output checklist (linted output, guardrails, ready to export).
   - CTA: Open Workbench (secondary, small).

4) **Library preview (secondary path)**
   - Message: reuse a public artifact when you need inspiration.
   - CTA: Browse Library (tertiary).
   - If empty: reinforce scan-first CTA.

5) **Final CTA block**
   - Restate the scan-first promise.
   - Primary CTA: Scan a folder.
   - Secondary CTA: Open Workbench.

## Copy tone
- Action-oriented, short sentences.
- Use consistent nouns: Scan, Workbench, Library, Translate, Docs.
- Avoid jargon unless in tooltips.

## Accessibility + layout
- Single H1 on page.
- Keep CTA buttons in a consistent order across sections.
- Ensure mobile view preserves CTA hierarchy (primary first).
