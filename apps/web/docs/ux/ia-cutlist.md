# IA cut list (focus on core flows)

Last updated: Dec 28, 2025

## Goal
Reduce cognitive load by emphasizing Scan, Workbench, Library, Translate, and Docs. All other routes remain accessible by direct URL but are de-emphasized in nav and landing copy.

## Core destinations (keep in nav + landing)
- Scan (`/atlas/simulator`)
- Workbench (`/workbench`)
- Library (`/library`)
- Translate (`/translate`)
- Docs (`/docs`)

## De-emphasize in nav and landing
These routes are still reachable but should not appear in primary navigation or homepage sections.
- `/atlas` landing pages and subpages (platforms, concepts, recipes, compare, changelog)
- `/browse` (legacy)
- `/templates`
- `/tags`
- `/skills`
- `/snippets`
- `/documents`
- `/files`
- `/changelog`
- `/tokens`
- `/labs`

## Navigation guidance
- **Primary nav:** Scan, Workbench, Library, Translate, Docs.
- **CTA hierarchy:**
  - Primary CTA: Scan a folder.
  - Secondary CTA: Open Workbench.
  - Tertiary link: Library (optional, once).
- **Footer:** mirror the core destinations only.

## Notes
- Do not remove routes; only prune visibility.
- Keep consistent naming across UI and docs (Scan, Workbench, Library, Translate, Docs).
